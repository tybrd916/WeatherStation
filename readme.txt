This WeatherStation project was inspired by http://hackaday.com/2012/09/17/turning-a-kindle-into-a-weather-display/ with a slightly different angle in that I wanted my young son and daughter to get a visual cue for how to dress (or bundle up) based on the weather forecast.  Then it morphed a little when I added an infographic chart of the hourly temperatures and precipitation forecast for the next 3 days and nights.
